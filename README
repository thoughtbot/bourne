= Bourne

Bourne extends mocha to allow detailed tracking and querying of stub and mock
invocations. It allows test spies using the have_received rspec matcher and
assert_received for Test::Unit. Bourne was extracted from jferris-mocha, a fork
of mocha that adds test spies.

== Test Spies

Test spies are a form of test double that preserves the normal four-phase unit
test order and allows separation of stubbing and verification.

Using a test spy is like using a mocked expectation except that there are two steps:

1. Stub out a method for which you want to verify invocations
2. Use an assertion or matcher to verify that the stub was invoked correctly

== Examples

  # rspec

  mock.should have_received(:to_s)
  Radio.should have_received(:new).with(1041)
  radio.should have_received(:volume).with(11).twice
  radio.should have_received(:off).never

  # Test::Unit

  assert_received(mock, :to_s)
  assert_received(Radio, :new) {|expect| expect.with(1041) }
  assert_received(radio, :volume) {|expect| expect.with(11).twice }
  assert_received(radio, :off) {|expect| expect.never }

See Mocha::API for more information.

Bourne was written by Joe Ferris. Mocha was written by James Mead. Several of
the test examples and helpers used in the Bourne test suite were copied
directly from Mocha.
